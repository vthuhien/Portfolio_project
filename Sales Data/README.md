## About This Data
Here's [link](https://github.com/vthuhien/Portfolio_project/blob/main/Sales%20Data/raw_data.csv) for the raw data
We will process in 2 parts according to business efficiency. This is the docx [script](https://github.com/vthuhien/Portfolio_project/blob/main/Sales%20Data/Analyze/Analyze%20Script.docx) abt it

## 1. Kpiâ€™s requirement
We need to analyze key indicators for our sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics :

 - 1 . Tolal Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders. 
 - 2 . Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the fotal revenue by the total number of orders. 
 - 3 . Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold. 
 - 4 . Total Orders: The total number of orders placed. 
 - 5 . Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.


## 2. Charts requirement
We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts : 

### 1. Daily Trend for Total Orders: 
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of fotal orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis. <br>
### 2. Hourly Trend for Total Orders: 
Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of fotal orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.  <br>
### 3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: 
Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contibution to overall sales.  <br>

### 4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: 
Generate a ple chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preferences for pirza sizes and their impact on sales.  <br>
### 5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: 
Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza categories.  <br>
### 6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold: 
Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the fatal number of pizzas sold. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza options.  <br>
### 7.Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Tofal Pizzas Sold: 
Create a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the fotal number of pizzas sold. This chart will enable us to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options. <br>

We use [Sql](https://github.com/vthuhien/Portfolio_project/blob/main/Sales%20Data/Analyze/SQLQuery.sql) statements to retrieve this data and after which we generate some visualization [charts](https://github.com/vthuhien/Portfolio_project/blob/main/Sales%20Data/Dashboard/Chart_Dashboard.pbix) by using Power Pi.<br>
Along with that, I also use Photoshop to design the sales background for psd [file](https://github.com/vthuhien/Portfolio_project/blob/main/Sales%20Data/Dashboard/Des_psd.psd).
